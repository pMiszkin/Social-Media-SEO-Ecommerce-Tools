<strong>To Webp Converter</strong>
- [converter.11zon.com](https://converter.11zon.com/) - I was looking for something to convert JPG to WebP for my online store. A lot of online converters didn’t reduce the file size satisfactorily, and some WebP images even ended up being larger than their JPG counterparts. This converter seems to work really well and can reduce a 2MB image to 120KB without significant loss of quality.
